# Shahar Lab: Global Project Rules & Architectural Philosophy

This file is the global memory bank for the lab's AI architecture. All AI agents, hooks, and skills must adhere to these non-negotiable rules. The canonical folder tree lives in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/project-scaffolding/references/folder_structure.md`.

## 1. Core Architectural Paradigm: "One Model, One Folder"
Every analytical task must be housed in its own isolated subfolder: empirical analyses (e.g. brms regressions) under `analysis/`, synthetic simulation studies (e.g. parameter recovery) under the top-level `simulation/` directory. Both use the identical canonical folder set (§3).

## 2. The Three Golden Rules of Operation

### I. The Artifacts Rule
- **No Data Duplication:** Data must NEVER be copied into local analysis/simulation folders.
- **Reading:** `main.R` reads clean data directly from the top-level `data/processed/` directory by default; the user may direct an analysis to another stage (e.g. `data/raw/`).
- **Writing:** The `artifacts/` folder within an analysis/simulation directory is exclusively reserved for generated or derived files (e.g. .rds model fits, MCMC draws, matrices, simulated datasets).
- **Visualization:** The `output/` folder is exclusively reserved for human-facing outputs (plots, figures, and tables).

### II. The Orchestration Rule
- **No Numbered Scripts:** Do not number files in the `code/` directory (e.g., avoid `01_...`). Numbering breaks when intermediate exploratory steps are added.
- **Source of Truth:** `main.R` is the ultimate conductor. Execution order is dictated entirely by reading the `source()` calls in `main.R` from top to bottom.
- **Polyglot Execution:** If a script is R, use `source()`. If Python, use `system("python code/script.py")` or `reticulate::source_python()`.

### III. The Clear Boundaries Rule
- **Mechanistic Models:** All .stan and mechanistic architecture files must live exclusively in `models/[MODEL_NAME]/`, one folder per model, containing `[MODEL_NAME].R` (generating code) and `[MODEL_NAME].stan` (fitting code).
- **Analytical Hub:** All workflows that evaluate, fit, or test models live in `analysis/` (empirical) or `simulation/` (synthetic) — never inside `models/`.

## 3. Standard Folder Structure (analysis/ and simulation/)
Every `analysis/[NAME]/` and `simulation/[NAME]/` folder must contain this exact hierarchy:
- `code/` : Short, highly targeted, unnumbered execution scripts.
- `artifacts/` : Derived model objects (machine-readable).
- `output/` : Human-readable figures and tables.
- `main.R` : The top-to-bottom execution orchestrator.
- `summary.md` : Metadata, hypotheses, and model outcomes.

## 4. Path Definition Mandate
**Every `main.R` must define directory paths explicitly at the top of the file** (after libraries are loaded, before any execution). This ensures portability, auditability, and reproducibility.

Required structure (`<parent>` is `analysis` or `simulation`):
```r
library(here)

project_root <- here::here()
artifacts_dir <- file.path(project_root, "<parent>", "<folder_name>", "artifacts")
output_dir    <- file.path(project_root, "<parent>", "<folder_name>", "output")
code_dir      <- file.path(project_root, "<parent>", "<folder_name>", "code")
```

**Rules:**
- `project_root` must use `here::here()` to find the repository root dynamically.
- All three directory variables (`artifacts_dir`, `output_dir`, `code_dir`) must be present and correctly reference the folder.
- All `source()` calls must use these variables: `source(file.path(code_dir, "script.R"))` — never hardcode paths.
- The parent and folder name in the paths must match the actual directory (e.g., if the analysis lives in `analysis/anxiety_exam_gender_interaction/`, the paths must say `"analysis", "anxiety_exam_gender_interaction"`).

**Why:** This contract ensures cloud runners, validation scripts, and future AI agents can locate and archive outputs consistently, and guarantees analyses run identically across machines.

## 5. Visualization Mandate: `/plot-posterior` Skill
All parameter summary plots (posterior distributions, credible intervals, parameter estimates) **must** use the `/plot-posterior` skill from the **plotting** tool capsule. This ensures:
- Consistent, publication-ready visualization across all analyses
- Centralized styling and aesthetic management
- Reproducible plot generation with audit trails

**No raw ggplot code for posteriors.** The skill handles all posterior visualization. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plotting/` for implementation details.

## 6. Operational Mandate
AI agents must prioritize brevity and modularity. If a script exceeds 80 lines, the agent must proactively suggest splitting it into smaller, focused modules orchestrated by `main.R`.
