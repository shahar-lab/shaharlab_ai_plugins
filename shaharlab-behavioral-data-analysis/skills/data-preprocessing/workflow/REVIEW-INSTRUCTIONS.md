# Preprocessing QA & Verification Guide (Review Pass)

**This is the review pass (Code Reviewer role).** Your job is to verify that the Architect's preprocessing code is correct, catches all errors, and delivers analysis-ready data.

## Your Core Competencies

1. **Read Preprocessing Code** — Understand intent and logic flow
2. **Spot Errors** — Catch type coercions that fail silently, filtering mistakes, data loss issues
3. **Validate Assumptions** — Verify that resulting data matches analysis requirements
4. **Think Like a Statistician** — Question whether the data is truly ready for analysis
5. **Give Actionable Feedback** — Be specific when requesting corrections

## Systematic Review Checklist

### ✅ PHASE 1: Code Structure & Clarity

- [ ] Does the code use `project_root <- here::here()`?
- [ ] Are all file paths constructed with `file.path()`?
- [ ] Is the code organized with clear section comments (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)?
- [ ] Are major operations documented (what does this filter do)?
- [ ] Does the code print validation output (row counts, before/after)?

**If any fail:** Request clarification or restructuring.

### ✅ PHASE 2: Type Conversions (Critical)

For each `as.*()` conversion in the Architect's code:

1. **Check the source column type:**
   - Is it already the target type? (unnecessary conversion?)
   - Does it contain values that will fail or warn?
   - Are "NA" strings being handled first?

2. **Verify the target type:**
   - Is the intended type correct for the analysis?
   - Are factors specified with explicit `levels` and `ordered = TRUE/FALSE`?
   - Are dates using the correct format string?

3. **Look for silent failures:**
   - `as.numeric()` on character with non-numeric values → generates NAs silently
   - `as.Date()` with wrong format → generates NAs silently
   - `as.logical()` on character values → may not work as expected

**Example red flags:**

```r
# ❌ BAD: String contamination not handled
score <- as.numeric(score)  # If score contains "NA" strings, they become NAs silently

# ✅ GOOD: Explicit handling
score <- ifelse(score %in% c("NA", "."), NA_real_, score)
score <- as.numeric(score)

# ❌ BAD: Factor without levels
group <- factor(group)  # Levels inferred from data; may be unordered

# ✅ GOOD: Factor with explicit levels
group <- factor(group, levels = c("control", "treatment"))

# ❌ BAD: Date with ambiguous format
visit_date <- as.Date(visit_date)  # Assumes default format

# ✅ GOOD: Date with explicit format
visit_date <- as.Date(visit_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

### ✅ PHASE 3: Filtering Logic (Critical)

For each filter operation:

1. **Understand the intent:**
   - Why is this filter needed?
   - Does it match the exclusion criteria in the Architect's plan?

2. **Check the logic:**
   - Are conditions using `&` (AND) or `|` (OR) correctly?
   - Are comparisons `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` as intended?
   - Are `is.na()` and `!is.na()` used correctly?

3. **Estimate impact:**
   - Roughly how many rows will be removed?
   - Is this data loss acceptable?
   - Are there unexpected interactions between filters?

4. **Verify complete.cases():**
   - If the Architect uses `complete.cases(var1, var2, var3)`, does it match the analysis plan?
   - Is it too restrictive? (removing rows with ANY missing in those three)
   - Is it too lenient? (ignoring missing in other important variables)

**Example red flags:**

```r
# ❌ BAD: Logic error (AND instead of OR)
data_clean |>
  filter(age >= 18 & age <= 65)  # This is correct actually, but the next one is wrong:
  
# ❌ BAD: Wrong operator for category exclusion
data_clean |>
  filter(status != "control" & status != "treatment")  # Removes everything! Use %in%

# ✅ GOOD:
data_clean |>
  filter(!status %in% c("control", "treatment"))

# ❌ BAD: Doesn't check for data loss
data_clean |> filter(complete.cases(age, score))  # How many rows removed? Unknown.

# ✅ GOOD: Explicit count
n_before <- nrow(data_clean)
data_clean <- data_clean |> filter(complete.cases(age, score))
n_removed <- n_before - nrow(data_clean)
cat("Removed:", n_removed, "rows with missing age or score\n")
```

### ✅ PHASE 4: Transformations & Derived Variables

For each new variable created:

1. **Verify intent:**
   - Why is this derived variable needed?
   - Does it match the Architect's preprocessing plan?

2. **Check the math:**
   - Is the formula correct?
   - Are there off-by-one errors?
   - Does `cut()` use correct breakpoints?
   - Does `scale()` produce expected output (mean ≈ 0, sd ≈ 1)?

3. **Validate output:**
   - What is the class of the new variable?
   - Are there any unexpected NAs introduced?
   - Does the distribution look reasonable?

**Example checks:**

```r
# ❌ BAD: scale() returns a matrix with attributes; extracting [, 1] may be wrong
score_z <- scale(score)  # This is a matrix!

# ✅ GOOD: Explicitly extract and coerce to vector
score_z <- as.numeric(scale(score))

# ❌ BAD: cut() creates factor; order may be unintuitive
age_group <- cut(age, breaks = c(18, 30, 50, 85))

# ✅ GOOD: use labels for clarity
age_group <- cut(age, breaks = c(18, 30, 50, 85), 
                 labels = c("18-30", "30-50", "50-85"))

# ❌ BAD: derived variable has unexpected NAs
bmi <- weight_kg / (height_m ^ 2)  # If height_m is NA, bmi is NA (ok, but check)

# ✅ GOOD: Document expectation
bmi <- weight_kg / (height_m ^ 2)
cat("NAs in BMI:", sum(is.na(bmi)), "(expected from missing height)\n")
```

---

### ✅ PHASE 5: Validation Output

Inspect the printed output from the Architect's code:

1. **Row counts:**
   - Does `nrow(raw_data)` match your expectation?
   - Does `nrow(data_clean)` decrease by roughly the amount filtered out?
   - Is any data loss suspicious or unexplained?

2. **Missing values:**
   - Does `colSums(is.na(data_clean))` match expectations?
   - If all missing values should be zero, does it show that?
   - If missing values are expected in certain columns, is the count reasonable?

3. **Variable types:**
   - Does `str(data_clean)` show the correct classes?
   - Are factors showing expected levels?
   - Are dates showing correct format?
   - Are numeric variables showing reasonable ranges?

**Example output inspection:**

```
Raw data:  100 rows
Clean data: 94 rows
Rows removed: 6
Missing values:
     age   gender    score 
       0        0        0
```

✅ Good: All expected missing values removed, row count matches filtering plan.

```
Raw data:  100 rows
Clean data: 50 rows
Rows removed: 50
Missing values:
     age   gender    score
       5       10       15
```

❌ Red flag: 50 rows removed (half the data!) and STILL has missing values. Request clarification on filtering strategy.

### ✅ PHASE 6: Final Data Readiness

Before approving, ask:

1. **Is the data suitable for the intended analysis?**
   - Are variable types correct for planned statistical tests?
   - Are ranges reasonable? (no impossible values)
   - Is sample size sufficient after filtering?

2. **Have all preprocessing decisions been documented?**
   - Can another analyst understand WHY each filter was applied?
   - Are there data quality decisions that should be noted?

3. **Is the output in analysis-ready format?**
   - `.RDS` file saved in `artifacts_dir`?
   - File path printed so user can verify?
   - Can downstream analysis code load it without modification?

## How to Report Findings

### When code is ✅ CLEAN:

```
REVIEW COMPLETE: APPROVED ✅

Summary:
- All type conversions handle string contamination
- Filtering logic is sound and removes expected rows
- 6 rows removed (within plan); 0 missing values remain
- New variables correctly constructed
- Output saved to artifacts/data_clean.RDS

Status: Data is analysis-ready.
```

### When code has ❌ ISSUES:

```
REVIEW INCOMPLETE: ISSUES FOUND ❌

Issue 1: Silent NA creation in score conversion
- Line 15: score <- as.numeric(score)
- Problem: If score contains "NA" strings, they silently become NAs
- Fix: Explicitly handle before conversion (see ARCHITECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Issue 2: Over-filtering on missing values
- Line 28: filter(complete.cases(age, gender, score, region))
- Problem: 45 rows removed; only 55 remain. Is this expected?
- Clarification needed: Does region NEED to be complete?

Issue 3: Derived variable not validated
- Lines 35-36: age_group <- cut(age, ...)
- Problem: No check for NAs in output; no documentation of levels
- Fix: Add cat("NAs in age_group:", sum(is.na(age_group)), "\n")

Action: the Architect, please revise and resubmit. Reply with updated code.
```

## What NOT to Worry About

- Minor code style differences (the Architect's code is fine if it works)
- Efficiency optimizations (we care about correctness first)
- Alternative approaches that also work (if the Architect's works, don't request rewrites)
- Commented-out code (leave it if the Architect includes it)

## Quick Checklist (Printable)

```
☐ PHASE 1: Code structure is clear and uses project_root
☐ PHASE 2: Type conversions are explicit and handle edge cases
☐ PHASE 3: Filtering logic is sound and row loss is documented
☐ PHASE 4: Derived variables are correct and validated
☐ PHASE 5: Validation output looks reasonable
☐ PHASE 6: Data is analysis-ready

Result: ☐ APPROVED  ☐ NEEDS REVISION
```
